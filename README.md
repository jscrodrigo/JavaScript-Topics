# Brief
This is a very, very basic demonstration of an average calculation code. To help You understand
some basics topics of programming.

# Topics covered
- How to declare variables in JavaScript
- How to use template strings and log it in the console.
- How to use conditional blocks (if/else);
 
# How to...
1) Declare variables:
  Nowadays the most common ways to declare variables are using `let` and `const`
  * const myName = 'Paul Stone';
  * const myAge = 22;
  * let myName02 = 'Ernie Smith';
  * let myAge02 = 30;
2) Use template strings and log it in the console:
  * console.log(`${yourVariable} followed by some text. You can also add math operations, conditionals,
   etc, inside the ${}`);
3) Use conditional blocks:
* `if(true){
    //do something if TRUE;
} else {
  do another thing if FALSE
}`
